=============
Bug Reporting
=============

OSF will setup and operate a mailing list for intake of bug reports.
The goal is to spend a little more time collecting information before
turning over to developers or hosters.  The developers and hosters are
not on that mailing list.

At the point action is needed, a bug will be filed in the appropriate
manner.  For hosting-related problems, and email will be sent to the
support address.  The development team will give a try at using
Pivotal Tracker.
