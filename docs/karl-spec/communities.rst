Communities
===========

KARL uses a Community for internal and external collaboration. The
ability for any staff member to create a community and invite outsiders
is a unique and powerful part of the KARL vision.

In a system with many communities, you need rich and useful ways to
list and find communities. You also need a Community that holds the
basic information about itself.
