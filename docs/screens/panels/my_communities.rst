====================
My Communities Panel
====================

Sidebar panel for :doc:`../communities/communities_view` and
:doc:`../profiles/profile_view`. Used when you are looking at your own
communities or looking at the profile of someone else.

Features
========

- Quick browsing of the communities you or someone else are in

- When a user is in a lot of communities, they can set their
  "preferred" communities to make the list more manageable


Specifications
===============

- By default, show all communities the person is in, for which the
  currently-requesting user has the rights to see

- If the panel is showing your communities, the heading should be "My
  Communities", otherwise "Firstname's Communities"

- That is, if the person is in a private community, and you visit their
  profile, you won't see that community listed in this panel unless
  you are also a member of that community (or an admin)

- Show the "private" and "moderator" badges

- A button "Set Preferred" that allows editing the list of communities
  that shows up in this box (on both screens)

- Only show this button when you are looking at your own communities

- When the filter is in place, show a "Edit Preferred" and "Show all"
  button. The latter temporarily shows all.

- When editing, show buttons for "Update", "Clear Preferred",
  and "Cancel"

- If a person joins a new community and they haven't made it a
  preferred community, it will not show up until they choose it
