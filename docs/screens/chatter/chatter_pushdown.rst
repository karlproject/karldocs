=======================
Chatter Pushdown Screen
=======================

The pushdown allows quick access to basic Chatter functions from any
screen. It is activated by clicking the "Chatter" menu item in the
global navigation menu.

Features
========

- All the normal features for pushdowns.

- Checking frequently with KARL to see if there are any new Chatter
  items and, if so, displaying a count as a "badge" on the menu item

- Adding a Chatter Post without leaving the current page

- Easily referring to the current page in your Chatter Post with a
  special tag (e.g. #this)

- Read a short list of posts from your Chatter Posts screen

- Read a short list of your (private) Messages

Non-Features
============

The pushdown is not meant to be the full Chatter interface,
but rather a summary. In particular, you shouldn't have operations that
would navigate away from the current page. Thus the following are not
part of the pushdown:

- We will show when something is in reply or reposted,
  but not provide links

- No "view" link on an individual post

- No repost/reply

Specifications
==============

- Whenever the Chatter Panel is displayed, clear the Unread badge and
  tell the server.

- Links to jump to Chatter Posts and Chatter Messages
