=====================
Chatter Topics Screen
=====================

When someone makes a post with a hash mark, such as
``I like #sometopic``, then ``#sometopic`` is a *topic*. KARL considers
those to be tags. Users can follow topics just like they follow
people. The *Chatter Topics* screen provides a listing of Chatter Posts
in any of the followed topics.
