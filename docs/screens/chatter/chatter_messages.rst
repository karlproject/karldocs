=======================
Chatter Messages Screen
=======================

Chatter Posts are visible to the "world" (within the OSF security
policy.) In particular, all staff can see any post by other staff.

Messages provide private, one-on-one, non-real-time conversations.

Specifications
==============

- You get to this screen in a number of ways:

  - Chatter pull-down, click on the link to go to Chatter,
    click on ``Messages`` in the header

  - Click on the link in the pulldown that goes straight to ``Messages``

  - Click on a specific message in the pulldown,
    which opens that conversation and scrolls to the message

- List of conversations on the left, conversation on the right

Non-Specifications
==================

- Like Twitter, *not* real-time messaging or presence detection

Notes
=====

- Only message to/from people you are following?

- Do we need to (later) provide a way to walk up to a profile or a
  Chatter person-screen and start a conversation?

- How do we get the sizing right?
