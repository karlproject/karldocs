=======================
Chatter Messages Screen
=======================

Chatter Posts are visible to the "world" (within the OSF security
policy.) In particular, all staff can see any post by other staff.

Messages provide private, one-on-one, non-real-time conversations.

No conversation selected:

Specifications
==============

- You get to this screen in a number of ways:

  - Chatter pull-down, click on the link to go to Chatter,
    click on ``Messages`` in the header

  - Click on the link in the pulldown that goes straight to ``Messages``

  - Click on a specific message in the pulldown,
    which opens that conversation and scrolls to the message

- List of conversations on the left, conversation on the right

- Each person represents one conversation (not multiple per person)

- Allow messaging any user that the general security model allows you
  to see (e.g. affiliates can message people in their communities)

Non-Specifications
==================

- Like Twitter, *not* real-time messaging or presence detection

- Don't make a requirement that you can only message people who are
  following you (KARL is a safer place than a 100m user public system)

- Group messaging is not needed

Future
======

- Fix the Chatter profile to allow walking up to someone and messaging
  them

Questions
=========

- How do we get the sizing right?
