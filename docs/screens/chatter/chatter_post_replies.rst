====================
Chatter Posts Screen
====================

In your Chatter "Posts" stream, sometimes you will see an entry that is
a reply. Perhaps it is you replying to a Chatter Post from someone you
follow. Or, someone you follow was replying to someone that you don't
follow. You want a way to see what was the orginal that was replied to,
and perhaps a way to see the entire conversation of replies from
everybody.

Specification
=============

- When a Chatter Post is in reply to something, show a link below the
  text that says "Replying to Person Name"

- Clicking the link shows, underneath and indented,
  the post that was being replied to

- Once clicked, the link changes back to "Hide original".

- Once "Replying to Person Name" is clicked, we also provide a link
  "Show full conversation" that goes to :doc:`chatter_postconversation`
