Chatter Post Conversation Screen
================================

When you reveal the original post in a reply, you have a link to ``View
converation``. This is the screen that you are taken to. You see the
Chatter post that was revealed by clicking "Replying to Person Name",
then all the replies to *that* post, sorted chronologically,
one level deep.
