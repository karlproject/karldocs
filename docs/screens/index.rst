==================
Listing of Screens
==================

Users think in terms of web pages. KARL developers think in terms of
views which might or might not share templates.

To bridge this gap, we'll use the term *screen* to refer to a visual
unit of division in KARL. Below is a listing of all the screens,
with a link to specification and description information for each
screen. The listing is organized by major area in KARL.
