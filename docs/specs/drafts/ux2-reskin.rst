UX2 Quick Reskin
================

Cosmetic restling changes on UX2 to better connote UX1,
based on feedback from OSF internal communications.

UX2 Goals
=========

As a reminder, below are some of the original degign goals of the UX2
project:

- "Fresh look for a fresh look"

- Distraction-free

- Focus more on content

- Clear separation between chrome and content

- Responsive design (works at different screen widths)

- Focused more on readability

- Flexible, fluid layout

- Where appropriate, cleanup some shared things in content (forms,
  grids, etc.)

- Understand app vs. website distinction

UX2 Quick Re-Skin Goals
=======================

In this initial effort, we're avoiding structural changes and simply
changing some quick cosmetics. The desired effects:

- Return to some of the aesthetic of UX1

- Take some commonality from the new soros.org redesign (fonts,
  portlet styling)

Actions
=======

Starting with the highest priority:

#. ``font-family`` based on soros.org (i.e. Helvetica, Arial,
   sans-serif)

#. ``font-size`` halfway between now and UX1/soros.org

#. Section menu gets a lighter, grayish background (instead of the
   aqua/green/blue current background.)

#. Section tools (blog, etc.) get a non-shadowed font

#. Remove beige background color in the content area.

#. Portlet styling directly stolen from soros.org to give a less-boxy,
   app-y feeling:

    - No outer box or background color

    - Top heading, bold, all caps

    - Separate rows with lines to allow wrapping

    - All combine to connote a box

    - Applies to left/middle column portlets as well

    - Get rid of "more" as a button, instead have a link in the bottom
      of the box, right aligned

#. Inactive section tools also don't get "de-emphasized". If needed,
   make inactive section tabs "pop more" (i.e. don't use a color so
   close to the background color). We hope that removing the shadow on
   inactive labels is enough.

#. Make action menu buttons be more compact

Questions
=========

- (Nat) If it is a goal to infer UX1, do we need to work in the UX1
  colors? E.g. the light blue gradient. See screencast at
