Ariadne Questions
=================

- Is a title/body needed?

- Is this Wiki-like?

- Is it the Blog Entry security model or the community content security
  model?

- What does "projects and tag them" mean? Is "tag" just a way of saying
 "fill in fields"?

- Is normal access model (KarlAdmin/KarlStaff/KarlAffiliate,
  community member and moderator) ok?


Tres/Paul Questions
===================

  community in one KARL

  catalog?
