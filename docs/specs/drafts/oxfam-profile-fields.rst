====================
Oxfam Profile Fields
====================

Oxfam has asked for some additional profile fields added in their
customization package.

Fields
======

- Employee ID. (string)

- Job title. (string)

- Division. (string)

- Manager. (string)

- Business mobile phone. (string)

- Skype name. (string)

- Office address. (string)

- Country. This is currently selected from a drop down list in Karl,
  but the administrator does not have the ability to update the country
  list. Either change this to a free text field, or enable the
  administrator to update the list of countries - go for the cheapest
  easiest option.

Specifications
==============

- These changes will only appear when viewing a profile and editing a
  profile. They do not appear as columns in the PEOPLE directory reports.

- Fields are editable by admin and by staff.

- Ordering when viewing the profile (old and new fields): Full name,
  Employee ID, Job title, Team, Department, Division, Manager,
  Email address, Extension, Business Telephone - landline,
  Business Mobile Phone, Skype name, Fax, Location (operating base),
  Office Address, Country, Organisation, Languages, Photo, Biography
  Last log in date

Extras
======

- Make the new columns available in the CSV export

Implementation
==============

- Added to the Oxfam customization package, thus not impacting others
  or available to others

- As such, it is up to Oxfam to test whether future KARL updates
  impact this feature

Questions
=========

- Confirm the list of existing profile fields with the ordering
  documented above
