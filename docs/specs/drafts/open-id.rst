==========================================
KIP 3: External Authentication with OpenID
==========================================

.. note::

  This specification does not include any of the OSF-specific work to
  handle different flavors of staff. Instead, it is just the minimum
  get staff authentication outside of KARL.


Notes
=====

- Devteam development/testing against anything requiring ActiveDirectory
  is a logistical challenge

- Try to use WSO2 for the Kerberos part

- Staff-only, removes their password from the KARL database

- Changes to the CSV upload
