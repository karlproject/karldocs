UX2 Deeper Reskin
=================

This project is a follow-on to :doc:`ux2-reskin`, going beyond minimal
cosmetics into structural changes and deeper cosmetic changes.

UX2 Deeper Re-Skin Goals
========================

- Correct misplaced or ill-fitting UI elements based on feedback

Searchbox
---------

- Move into global toolbar based on the :doc:`searchbox` proposal

Personal Menu
-------------

- Shorten personal name

- Make avatar into drop down menu button

- Move "logout" into the dropdown

- Consider making that pushdown with recent content, etc.

- Provide a library of avatars

Global Toolbar
--------------

- Get rid of gear with "tags" by moving tags into its own menu item
  (or moving Feeds and Tags into Radar, if that project is approved)

Section
-------

- Consider tightening to one line


Chatter
-------

- Make it behave just like other links

- Take the pushdown stuff and put either in Radar or in Personal

Content
-------

- Move tagbox back under resource title, in greatly condensed form

- Get rid of sidebars where they are not needed

- Work harder to get the resource title up

- Especially, with searchbox now moved up, resolve the action menu
  challenge

- Get rid of button motif for chrome links

Intranet Home page
------------------

- Inspired by sorosny.org  layout

- Get a tablet-optimized version


Questions
=========

- Do we need to support multiple "themes", just to get out of the trap
  of "what's the ultimate decision?"

- What value is there placed on the responsive design?
