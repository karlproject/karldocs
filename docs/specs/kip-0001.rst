KIP 1: Search Results Preview With Searchbox
============================================

The searchbox (formerly LiveSearch) shows a useful subset of the full
searchresults in a non-disruptive, in-page panel *as you type*.

Mockup
======

.. raw:: html

  <img height="833" width="660"
   src="https://agendaless.mybalsamiq.com/projects/karl/Searchbox.png"
   />

Goals
=====

- Make the panel look more like UX2

- Try harder to get all the results in the viewport without scrolling

- Speedup the dominant case (looking for a person)

- Give some options for improving performance via narrowing by default

Details
=======

- Try to get the search box into the global header by making it
  narrower and smaller font size

- Consider making the panel that appears on keystroke into a pushdown,
  giving it all the width. We'll have to do extra work to make it
  obvious how to dismiss it (pressing escape, an (x) symbol in the
  searchbox that dismisses, an explicit "close" link)

- Make a place in the panel for knobs, including the content picker and
  the context picker

- Get rid of 3 characters if we switch back ends to expand prefixes
