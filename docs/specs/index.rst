Specifications
==============

With multiple organizations using KARL and developing KARL,
the project needed a system for initiating and tracking higher-level
changes.

Proposals are a light-weight way to record ideas that are still very
much in discussion. When a proposal gets some blessing,
we invest more time in a proper "specification". These are called KIPs
(KARL Improvement Proposal), and each KIP is uniquely numbered.

The specification process itself documented in KIP-0000.
