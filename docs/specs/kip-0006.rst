======================
KIP 5: Chatter Phase 2
======================

Chatter Pushdown
================

Jane re-chatters or replies to a quip
-------------------------------------

When reading the quips in the pushdown panel, Jane sees something
interesting that she'd like to share. She hovers over the quip,
sees a button for re-chattering and a button for replying,
and clicks on the appropriate button.

Spec:

- Q: If that simply copies something into the quick-add,
  what if you had something there already?
