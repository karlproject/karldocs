===============================================
KIP 6: Chatter Phase 2, Chatter Full UX Minimum
===============================================

:doc:`kip-0004` covered the features needed for Chatter's pushpanel.
That is the summary view of Chatter. In this KIP,
we still stay with the minimum needed to launch. But we cover the full
UX for Chatter. That is, what you get when you navigate to the URL for
Chatter.

.. note::

   The word ``quip`` is a placeholder for the final word we'll use to
   name an item that is Chattered.

Jane re-chatters or replies to a quip
-------------------------------------

When reading the quips in the pushdown panel, Jane sees something
interesting that she'd like to share. She hovers over the quip,
sees a button for re-chattering and a button for replying,
and clicks on the appropriate button.

Spec:

- Q: If that simply copies something into the quick-add,
  what if you had something there already?
