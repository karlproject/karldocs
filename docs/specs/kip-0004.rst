KIP 4: Chatter Overview
=======================

Chatter is a microblogging tool in KARL for lightweight communication.
This KIP provides an overview of the business needs and plans for
Chatter, with links to more KIPs for detail.

Goals
=====

- Increase usage by lowering the barrier for content creation

- Allow lightweight, personal communication such as provided by tools
  like Twitter

- Promote inter-personal communication and relations via social tools

Background
==========

KARL has a strong facility for team communication (communities) and a
modest facility for organizational communication (intranets.) KARL
doesn't have a facility for personal or social communication,
as you have to put your content in a community.

One approach would be to ask all OSF users to get an account on a
commercial service such as Twitter. This has a couple of downsides.
First, content leaks out into a commercially-motivated (read: ads)
service hosted in the U.S. (read: Safe Harbor.) Second,
KARL's mantra is "a well-integrated suite of simple tools." Spreading
business information amongst multiple disparate systems has some
downsides.

Fortunately KARL has a number of ingredients already for a simple
version of such a tool:

- *Identity*. In OSF's case, controlled by GSA.

- *UX*. Especially with Bottlecap, a well-designed entry point to add
  this service into.

- *Security*. A rich-but-simple authorization approach that lets only
  the right people see the right things.

- *Tagging*. A way to socially organize content.

- *Email-out/Email-in*. Tell people about relevant posts. Allow posting
  from email.

Overall Features
================

*Note: Specifics will be listed under each phase.*

- Easily create new posts, reply to or re-send posts by others

- See posts that matter to you

- Watch posts by specific friends and colleagues

- Send direct, private messages to others

- Productive UX: fast, non-disruptive, uncluttered, tablet/phone-friendly

- Promote a curated-mode of bottom-up organizational communication

Questions
=========

- Should "quips" be content that is searchable?

- Security model for who should see what
