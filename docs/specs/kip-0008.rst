KIP 6: Seeing New Activity with Notifications
=============================================

Content gets created in KARL that might need attention by a user. If
they don't reload a page, they won't know there's something for them.

Notifications is a system to check with the KARL server every N seconds
and visually let the UX tell the person something new is waiting for
them.
